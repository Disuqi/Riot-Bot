# League-of-Legends-Bot
A Discord bot that has some features to help you in the game called League of Legends. 
## Commands (not up to date)
### !champ
This command gives you an image for a random champion, I did this so that if you want a random champ pick in a draft game or ranked you can do so. I did this beacause the game does not allow you to pick random champs in those two specific game modes (Draft normal and any ranked game)
### !counter champion
This command allows you to see the counters for a champion. To do so you need to replace the word champion with what champ you are looking for.
### !team random 
This command let's you make a team and then it will return for each member of the team the champion and lane he has to play. This is completly random and it's what makes it fun.
### !mix
This is for when you are more than 5 people and you decide you want to play custom, you will want to mix the teams up in a random way, this does it for you, just type !mix and then there will be an option for players to join and it will make the two teams for you
### !help
This shows you all the commands and what they do
